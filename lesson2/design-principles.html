            <h2>PARC: Alignment</h2>
            <p> League of Legends - Riot Games
                <br>
                <a href="https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/">https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/</a> </p>

            <p>Nothing should be placed on the page arbitrarily. Every element should have some visual connection with
                another element on the page. This creates a clean and sophisticated look. I love how League of Legends
                Alignments are set out. Content is either aligned Center or Justified. Content and items are grouped
                together on the page with the same Alignment. This
                makes it easy for the user to group information together and see their belonging. This makes reading
                clean and there is no confusion to users.

            <h2>PARC: Contrast</h2>
            <p> Valorant - Riot Games
                <br>
                <a href="https://playvalorant.com/en-gb/">https://playvalorant.com/en-gb/</a> </p>

            <img src="images/valorant.jpg" width="400" alt="screenshoot of valorant on mobile web browsing">
            <p>Contrast is often the most important visual attraction on a page—it’s what makes a reader look at the
                page in the first place. It also clarifies the communication. Valorant has great Contrast for me. I feel
                the background color chosen really makes the font stand out.
                The color of the font is also in good Contrast with the background and other elements on the page. The
                font is easy to read and accessible for users. </p>

            <h2>White Space and Clean Design</h2>
            <p> Discord
                <br>

                <a href="https://discord.com/">https://discord.com/</a> </p>
            <img src="images/discord.jpg" width="400" alt="screenshoot of discord on mobile web browsing">
            <p>The White Space that is used in this design makes it visually appealing and more organized. The white
                space is not trapped between elements. I feel Discord has created a Clean Design for their users and
                others that visit their page to learn more
                about them. Discord has also added enough white space in their design to allow users eye rest and area
                to breath. The design is neatly created with no elements cramped on the page. Layout is user friendly
                and easy to navigate around.</p>
