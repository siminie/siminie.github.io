                <h3>1. A Diver's Delight: Palancar Reef</h3>
                <p>The island is extremely popular as a destination for snorkelers and scuba divers, who are spoilt for
                    choice when it comes to choosing which lovely reef to explore. One of the best spots to dive is the
                    Palancar Reef, rising from depths of up to 80 meters to shallows just beneath the surface of the sea
                    at the southwest end of the island. A popular dive includes a large bronze figure of Christ placed
                    some 17 meters underwater. Other good diving locales are on the San Francisco, Para√≠so, Columbia,
                    and Maracaibo reefs, as well as the Santa Rosa Wall.</p>

                <h3>2. Celarain: Cozumel's Lighthouse</h3>
                <p>One of the most interesting natural attractions on Cozumel is Laguna Chankanaab, a small freshwater
                    lake just seven kilometers south of San Miguel de Cozumel in the National Marine Park. Cut off from
                    the sea (apart from a number of underground channels), it's a popular spot for outings thanks to its
                    crystal-clear water and numerous colorful tropical fish, and is an enchanting place to swim,
                    snorkel, and scuba dive.</p>

                <h3>3. Dolphin Experiences</h3>
                <p>Another top-rated attraction on the island is Dolphin Discovery Cozumel. Situated in Chankanaab
                    National Park, the location itself is stunningly beautiful and, with its reefs, makes for an
                    excellent place to linger and try your hand at some snorkeling or diving. A variety of dolphin
                    experiences are offered, including some with swimming fun as they tow you through the water. </p>

            <h2>History of Cozumel</h2>
            <p>The advanced Mayan culture hit its peak from the VII century until the IX century. They considered
                Cozumel to be a sacred sanctuary and called it ‚ÄúCuzaam Luumi‚Äù which means land or place of the swallows.
